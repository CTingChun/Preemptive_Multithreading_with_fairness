# Operating System 2019 Spring Checkpoint 04

## Preemptive Multithreading
For this programming project checkpoint, you are to test your preemptive multithreading and semaphore code by extending the classical bounded-buffer example to two producers and one consumer. The two producers will compete with each other for writing. 
You should make a new directory and copy the source files from the previous checkpoint. Make a copy of testpreempt.c and name it test3threads.c. This is your opportunity to stress test your semaphore and threads code. If your previous checkpoints worked but this one doesnâ€™t, then something is wrong with your code. Debug here and once it works, then apply those changes to your previous checkpoints to see if they still work.



## Todo
1. **Turn in the source files for preemptive multithreading to be compiled using SDCC and targets EdSim51.**
2. test3threads.c, which contains the startup code and sets up the 2-producers, 1-consumer example.
