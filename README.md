# Operating System 2019 Spring Checkpoint 03

## Preemptive Multithreading
For this programming project checkpoint, you are to implement (1) semaphore with busy wait for your preemptive multithreading and (2) test your code using the **classical bounded-buffer** example. 
You should make a new directory and copy the source files from the previous checkpoint. No need to create new files.  Instead, first add the semaphores in preemptive.h (and preemptive.c if necessary).  Second, use the semaphore primitives to write the revised producer/consumer example.


## Todo
1. **Turn in the source files for preemptive multithreading to be compiled using SDCC and targets EdSim51.**
2. testpreempt.c , which contains the startup code and sets up the producer-consumer example.
3. preemptive.c , preemptive.h , which contains the cooperative multithreading code.
4. Turn in the typescript for compiling your code using the provided Makefile.
